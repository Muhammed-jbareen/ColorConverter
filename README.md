# ColorConverter
ColorConverter is an Arduino library that simplifies working with colors. It allows you to convert between common color models—RGB, HEX, and HSL—and also provides an easy way to get the color name (like "red," "blue," "yellow") for a given color.

## Features
* Convert between RGB, HEX, and HSL color models.
* Retrieve human-readable color names for any RGB, HEX, or HSL value.
* Useful for LED projects, display output, and any microcontroller project involving color manipulation.

## Supported Color Models
* **RGB**: Red, Green, Blue model (0–255 range per channel).
* **HEX**: Hexadecimal format (e.g., #FF5733).
* **HSL**: Hue, Saturation, Lightness model (Hue 0–360, Saturation and Lightness 0–100).
